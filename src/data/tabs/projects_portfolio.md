    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        This module gathers three classes. This is an important module because it includes the biggest project of the semester. We improved our English with this project since every deliverable must be in English. Moreover, the portfolio is the completion of the semester since it regroups every skill and knowledge we acquired during the semester.

            Everyone is used to standard GPS geopositioning in their car, in their phone or in their computer. Standard GPS receivers have an accuracy between 2 to 10 meters, and only in outdoor conditions. As a group of 5 students, we teamed up to answer a problem raised by our tutor, professor Guillaume Auriol: to geolocate meteorological balloons in association with a Paul Sabatier team led by Professor Hassan Sabbah. As you can guess, the standard GPS is not accurate enough to precisely locate the balloon. So, our tutor was interested in a Real-Time Kinetics (RTK) solution since its accuracy is far more precise. The launch of the ArduSimple starter kit LR offered a relatively low-cost RTK module. Therefore, the aim of our project is to assess this solution to see if it is compatible with the needs of the project. As you can in the picture, we were in possession of an ArduSimple starter kit LR composed of:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            <li>2 simpleRTK2B boards (Rover and Base Station)</li>
            <br>
            <li>2 Radio Modules LR (Long Range) with Xbee + 2 radio antennas</li>
            <br>
            <li>2 u-blox ANN-MB-00 Antenna for GNSS Dual Band with cable (IP67)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Base and Rover preconfiguration</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
            In terms of results, I am happy of what we achieved. We obtained the position of the rover with an acurracy of 2 cm. We also were able to retrieve the position of the rover directly on the base station. We store the position in a Firebase database and we display it on a map in our website. Finally, we wrote a complete state-of-the-art to explain our research about the RTK technology and its comparison with other technologies like GPS and DGPS.

        <summary style="color: #42a5f5">Innovative project</summary>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The first challenge we encounter was to assimilate the new notions. We had to do a lot of research to understand the RTK technology and architecture. These notions are truly complex and took us a lot of time to comprehend. Moreover, we used some new technologies to build a database and display a map on our website. After all, we still managed to do everything we wanted and learned a lot of new skills. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Even if the kit in our possession was supposed to be “plug & play”, we had a hard time finding the right configuration to obtain an RTK positioning. First, we had difficulties reading the raw frames obtained with the XCTU software. So, we created a program using an ESP32 to recover the frames and parse them. Then, to find the root of our problem, we linked the base and the rover’s board together. In doing so, we realized that it was the Xbee module that were not properly configured. So then, we configured the Xbee module the right way, with the good baudrate. This solution was found thanks to research and strategic thinking. It truly was a team effort. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            One of the main challenges was to find the right time and place to do the experiments. As a matter of fact, to have a RTK positioning, you need an open-sky view. If we do not have that, it is impossible to have an accuracy of a few centimeters. Moreover, since we are in winter, it was difficult to test outside because our computers would not hold long enough to really test our solution.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The entire semester is provided in English. It is an important part of the 5ISS classes, but it was mostly linked to the Innovative project since every deliverable was to be in English. We had two project reviews in English to present the progress we made throughout the semester. Moreover, the report must be written in English. Thus, we had a lot of opportunities to improve our English, both oral and written. Moreover, we had English class since the first year at INSA Toulouse, so we made huge progress since the beginning of our school days. Obviously, there are still many ways that we can improve it, but I really feel like I had made progress on my presentation skills in English, having a better energy and fluidity in my speech.

        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            The first challenge was to decide how to display my portfolio. I already decided to do a website, so I can learn new skills. The main challenge of course is writing the content of the portfolio, but this will be the focus of the analytical part. I chose to use a fun template for my portfolio. That is why I decided to use this template. It represents a Visual Studio Code page. I used it because to me, it symbolizes all my projects since I used VS Code for almost all of them.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            This website was realized using React, TypeScript, JSON, Markdown and HTML5. While I used a template, the change I mage in the layout and choice of content really improved my web design skills. Even though it is not a domain really taught at INSA, I personally enjoy doing it. Moreover, it allowed me to prepare a little bit for my internship since I will be using React to do some web development. Thus, I really like the opportunity to improve my skills thanks to the portfolio. I just wished I had more time to completely create my website from scratch instead of using a template.

            I was really invested in the Innovative project because I was interested in the subject. It was full of challenges, but we managed to overcome them all and even going further than I even would have imagined at the beginning of the semester. Thus, I am very proud of my team for doing so. I used all the skills I gain this semester to resolve our problems. I did the major part of all the research about the GPS, DGPS and RTK technologies. I also used an ESP32 to parse the frames received by the base station.Moreover, I gained more skills by using different tools like Firebase or Mapbox. With this project, I feel that I truly improved my technical skills but also my presentation and communication skills. I improved my English by writing the report and presenting the project.

            Likewise, I am proud of my portfolio. During all the semester, I was pretty frustrated because I felt like I did not have time to really invest myself into the different deliverables we had to produce. So, I knew that I wanted to spend a lot of time on this portfolio. I wanted to make it as good as I could. I used my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript too help understand React. I really wanted to use React to prepare for my internship. Even though I started late, like most part of the students, I wanted to end over all of my other reports before the Christmas holidays to be sure to have time to work on my portfolio during this time. The layout of the website was very important but the content of it was even more. I chose to only talk about my 5th year modules and my 4th year internship because of the density of the 5th year. I thought there was already enough notions and skills to present to fill the entire portfolio.

        <summary style="color: #42a5f5">General review and feedback on the course</summary>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I wanted, for this feedback, to make a conclusion of this semester. I really liked how the semester was built with all the modules given to us to help us with our Innovative project. We clearly saw that all the classes, the tutorials, the labs, and the side projects helped us with the final project. I think that the modules really succeeded to convey that feeling.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I was very satisfied with my choice to go in ISS. I really the kind of module like Smart Devices as it depicted exactly what I expected from ISS. Every class and lab were working together toward a bigger project. I have no doubt about the difficulty to establish this kind of module. So, I am very happy that I could beneficiate of all the feedbacks the older students made and the work of the professors and tutors which made this quality teaching possible.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
           However, this does not mean that I was not satisfied with the teaching of the year. There were some really good and interesting modules, expecially Smart Devices. To me, it really encapsulates the spirit of ISS as I see it. All the classes in the module flow well together, there are dedicated requirements for every background, and you build a real tangible thing in the end that you can be proud of.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            Coming from Electronics and being always torn apart between Electronics and Computer Science, the ISS module was the best I choice I could make, and I will never regret choosing it. It was the bridge between the two domains and was exactly how I imagined my last semester would be. I truly feel like the focus of this year was not really on reaching expert levels in every skill, but rather know how to make all these domains work together in engineering projects. One of the most important skill this semester, in my opinion, was not a technical skill but instead a managerial and problem-solving skill. In fact, we had to integrate different problematics from completely distinct domains. To me, the term Innovative was truly illustrated by that.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            I feel like I learned a lot during this short period of time. The semester was undoubtably dense was it in terms of deliverables, deadlines, projects, and notions. I think that I had to rush some assignments due to that and it saddens me because I would have sincerely like to go deeper in each project. I think that I was not able to show everything I am able to do in so little time. I am particularly thinking about the Communication module and I feel sad because it is one of the domains where I am the least confident with, but unfortunately, I did not find time to invest myself in it as much as I would have wanted to.
        </P>
        <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
            If someone asks me if I would do it again if I could, I will answer positively without hesitation. This semester was truly interesting and fun and the only thing that I regret is not having enough time to fully exploit all the projects. Having only one exam and working on so many different projects was intense and all-consuming, but also honestly satisfying. The end of the year was a real rush, especially for our Innovative project, but I am happy with how it all came out in the end. I am very grateful that had the opportunity the experience this kind of formation and I think it was a wonderful way to prepare us for the next chapter of our life.
