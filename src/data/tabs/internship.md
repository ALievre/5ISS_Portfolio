<h3 style="color: #f0e613">4th year internship at Vitesco Technologies</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 2%; text-align: justify;">
    I wanted to talk about my 4th year internship in this portfolio because I think it was an important part of my education. Even though it lasted only 3 months, I learned a lot during this internship.

        I did my internship at Vitesco Technologies within the Mechatronic Sensor Module (MSM) where Vitesco is developing Door Handle Sensor (DHS). The product is based on the CANoe communication network. In addition, many tests must be carried out to guarantee the correct functioning of the product. During this internship, my goal was to collect the testing needs of the DHS project and to use the CANoe tool to develop a generic interface while providing a library that can be used by future projects. My work was deconstructed into different steps: 
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; text-align: justify;">
        1.	Familiarize with existing technologies (capacitive sensor / BLE/ NFC) and with the CANoe software. <br>
        2.	Collect the project needs and read the documentation to understand what was expected of my work. <br>
        3.	Normalize the already existing code. <br>
        4.	Develop the modules based on CAPL and create panels to test the NFC. They needed this panel to test the NFC protocol quickly without having to modify the code each time. <br>
        5.	Upgrade the routine control SFD UDS panel. <br>
        6.	Perform the tests and training. <br>
        7.	Present my work to the team. <br>
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        <b>Why CANoe?</b> This software can emulate the sensor's interface on a vehicle. It makes it possible to develop, test and analyze individual ECU or a network of ECU.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        <b>NFC:</b> NFC or Near-Field Communication is a proximity-based wireless communication standard.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        <b>SFD:</b>  SFD, Security Fahrzeug Diagnosis, means Vehicle Diagnosis Protection. It is the procedure recovering a certified token to use UDS services.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        <b>UDS:</b> UDS or Unified Diagnostic Services is a communication protocol used for ECU diagnosis, debugging and configuration.

    <summary style="color: #f0e613">Technical challenges</summary>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        I faced multiple challenges during this internship, but I succeeded to overcome them all. That is what was satisfying about this internship.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        The first challenge was to arrive in the middle of a project. It took me some time to get familiar with the goals of this project, the equipment used, and the code already written. But with a lot of research, by reading the documentation and questioning my tutors.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        Another challenge was to understand the technologies used: CAN networks, NFC protocols, etc. Like the first challenge, I resolve my problem the same way.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2%; margin-left: 2%; text-align: justify;">
        The biggest challenge was to learn how to use the CANoe software. This is a very complete and complex software that emulates the CAN network of a vehicle. It also allows the creation of controls panels and tests. Due to its complexity, it took me a long time to understand how to manipulate it.
